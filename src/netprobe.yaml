    # Health Score Weights
    # - These are the relative weights used to calculate your 'Internet Quality Score', they can be modified but must add up to 1.0
    weights:
      loss: 0.6 # Loss is 60% of score
      latency: 0.15 # Latency is 15% of score
      jitter: 0.2 # Jitter is 20% of score
      external_dns_latency: 0.05 # DNS latency is 5% of score
      internal_dns_latency: 0.0 # Internal DNS latency is 0% of score

    # Health Score Thresholds
    # - These threshold values are used in the calculation of your 'Internet Quality Score', they can be modified if required
    thresholds:
      loss: 5 # 5% loss threshold as max
      latency: 100 # 100ms latency threshold as max
      jitter: 30 # 30ms jitter threshold as max
      dns_latency: 100 # 100ms dns latency threshold as max
# Speetest configuration (be very careful when running on a metered connection!)
# - This configuration is for setting up a "speed test" or rather a test of your internet bandwidth.
# - In order to test your upload and download bandwidth we use speedtest.net as source. So your client will connect there and upload and download some data.
# - That also means that a random server is selected for the test (usually the nearest one)
# - Setting the SPEEDTEST_INTERVAL too agressively will cause speedtest.net to block your requests, recommend 15 minutes (900 seconds) and above
speedtest:
  enabled: no # set this to "True" to enable speed test function
  interval: 937 # interval on which the speedtest will run, in seconds - note using a prime number helps reduce the number of collisions between netprobe and speed tests
